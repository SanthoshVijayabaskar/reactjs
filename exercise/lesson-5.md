## React Components & Lifecycle Methods

React provides several lifecycle methods, where various tasks can be performed during different stages of the Component Lifecycle.

(From Official DOC):
Methods prefixed with **'will'** are called right before something happens, and methods prefixed with **'did'** are called right after something happens.
