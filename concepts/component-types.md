* Container Components are ones which either owns a State varible (In React JS) or receives the data from the Provider (In Redux). 
* Container Component are the ones which also holds some amount of UI logic and contains/calls other child components.

* Presentational Components are ones which also dosen't perform any UI logic and stays more generic implementation
